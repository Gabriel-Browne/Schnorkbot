Hello, world!

Overall:  Write code in VS Code
    When done Save code, then sync changes made locally to GitHub

GitHub manages team actions, keeps files sync'd...

GitHub terms
    - commit: save change slocally with a message
    - push: put saved changes into the cloud (GitHub)
    - fetch: load new changes from the cloud 
    - pull: install those changes onto local machine
    - branch: 
        A GitHub branch is a parallel version of a
        repository that allows you to work on different
        features or changes without affecting the main codebase.
        It is essentially a lightweight pointer to a specific commit.
        Branches are commonly used for tasks such as bug fixes,
        feature development, or experimentation.

"Version Zero"
World/Map
    - 2D grid
    - limited, for now. 100x100 Origin is center of the map
    - we can put agents in it

Agent types:
    - agents move freely on the map, not constrained by the grid
    - common stats among all agents:
        - health
        - attack damage
        - attack rate
        - movement speed
    - dynamic variables (change constantly during gametime)
        - movement direction
        - shooting direction

    - Good guys - Schnorks
        - movement
            - move away from enemies
        - shooting attack
            - shoot towards nearest enemy
    - bad - Ants
        - Melee attack
        - spawn in (randomly) on the map
        - move towards the nearest Shnork (slowly), maybe with some random noise in movement


Second stage agent abilities:
    - communication
    - constrained vision
        - like robot war, with "scanning"
        - to start, assume we can always identify nearest enemy (all enemies), etc.

Third Stage
     - Reproduction, evolution
     - Cooperation
